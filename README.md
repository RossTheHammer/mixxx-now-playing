# mixxx-now-playing
Little script to help OBS display the currently playing track from Mixxx (Linux only)

This script takes the Artist - Title of the currently playing song in Mixxx and writes it to a text file. This is accomplished by reading the window title of Mixxx, which updates every time a new song is played.

You need to have xdotool installed
